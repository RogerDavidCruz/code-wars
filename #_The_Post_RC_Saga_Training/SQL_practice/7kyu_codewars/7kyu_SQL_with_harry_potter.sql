-- 7 kyu - SQL with Harry Potter: Sorting Hat Comparators
-- https://www.codewars.com/kata/5abcf0f930488ff1a6000b66/train/sql
--
-- There is truly no magic in the world; the Hogwarts Sorting Hat is SQL-based, its decision-making powers are common operators and prospectIve students are merely data - names, and two columns of qualities.
--
-- students
--
-- id
-- name
-- quality1
-- quality2
-- Slytherin are being quite strict this year and will only take students who are evil AND cunning.
-- Gryffindor will take students who are brave but only if their second quality is NOT evil.
-- Ravenclaw accepts students who are studious OR intelligent.
-- Hufflepuff will simply take those who have the quality hufflepuff.
--
-- (don't worry, for simplicity's sake 'brave' and 'studious' will only appear in quality1, and 'cunning' and 'intelligent' will only appear in quality2.)
--
-- Return the id, name, quality1 and quality2 of all the students who'll be accepted, ordered by ascending id.


SELECT id, name, quality1, quality2
FROM students
WHERE ((quality1='evil' AND quality2='cunning') OR (quality1='brave' AND quality2<>'evil')
OR (quality1='studious' OR quality2='intelligent')
OR (quality1='hufflepuff' OR quality2='hufflepuff'))
GROUP BY id, name, quality1, quality2
ORDER BY id
